### **Twitter/X Viral Thread**
```
ðŸ§µ THREAD: I just calculated something that will make you angry...

1/10 Spotify pays $0.003 per stream. 

That means you need 333,333 streams to make $1,000.

Meanwhile, 100 fans buying a $10 album = $1,000.

Why are we accepting this? ðŸ§µ

I just found out I could earn $2,847 MORE per month selling directly to fans vs streaming.
