## üìß Outreach Templates

### Email Template 1: Personal Introduction
**Subject:** You're invited to shape the future of independent music

Hi [Artist Name],

I've been following your music and I'm genuinely impressed by [specific song/release/achievement]. Your approach to [specific aspect of their music/career] really resonates with what I'm building.

I'm Jason Ino, founder of Not a Label - a new platform where independent artists keep 100% of their music revenue. No record deals, no middlemen, just direct connections between you and your fans.

I'm personally inviting 100 founding artists to help shape this platform, and I'd love for you to be one of them.

**As a founding artist, you'll get:**
‚Ä¢ Lifetime reduced platform fees (10% vs standard 15%)
‚Ä¢ Founding Artist badge and recognition
‚Ä¢ Direct input on new features
‚Ä¢ Priority support
‚Ä¢ Early access to everything we build

**Why I built this:**
Every stream on Spotify pays $0.003. That means you need 1 million streams to earn $3,000. On Not a Label, selling 300 albums at $10 each earns the same amount - and you keep every dollar.

I believe artists like you deserve better. Interested in learning more?

Best,
Jason Ino

P.S. - We're launching next week. Only [X] founding artist spots remain.

That's exactly what Not a Label enables. We're a direct-to-fan platform where independent artists keep 100% of their music sales revenue.

**The math:**

‚Ä¢ Not a Label: 1,000 fans √ó $10 album = $10,000 (all yours)

I'm personally inviting you to be one of our first 100 founding artists because [specific reason - their music style, career approach, fan engagement, etc.].
