## Twitter/X Threads

### Thread 1: Why Independence Matters
```
1/ 🧵 The music industry wants you to believe you need a label to succeed.

Here's why that's no longer true:

2/ Labels used to provide:
- Studio access ❌ (Now: home studios + AI)
- Distribution ❌ (Now: direct digital access)
- Marketing ❌ (Now: social media)
- Funding ❌ (Now: crowdfunding/streaming)

3/ What labels still take:
- 80% of your revenue 📉
- Your master rights 📜
- Creative control 🎨
- Years of your career ⏰

4/ Enter @notalabel:
✅ Keep 100% ownership
✅ AI production suite included
✅ Built-in distribution
✅ Advanced analytics
✅ Direct monetization

5/ Real example:
Beta user @artistname went from 1K to 50K monthly listeners in 6 months.
Revenue: $12K (kept all of it)
With a label: $2.4K 😱

6/ The tools exist. The platforms exist. The audience exists.

All you need is the courage to bet on yourself.

7/ Ready to take control of your music career?

Join 10,000+ artists building their future at not-a-label.art

Your music. Your career. Your choice. 🚀
