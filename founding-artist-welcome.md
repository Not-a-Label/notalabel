Not a Label exists because the music industry is broken. Labels take 80-90% of revenue. Streaming pays pennies. Artists struggle while middlemen profit.

We're changing that. Forever.

As a founding artist, you're not just a user - you're a partner in this revolution. Your success is our success. Your feedback shapes our future.

Remember: You keep 100% of your revenue. No exceptions. No fine print. No BS.

Welcome to the future of music.
