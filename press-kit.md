## üì∞ PRESS RELEASE

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

### Not a Label Launches Revolutionary Platform Where Independent Artists Keep 100% of Music Revenue

*Platform challenges traditional music industry model with direct-to-fan approach and AI-powered career tools*

**[City, Date]** - Not a Label, a groundbreaking music platform that enables independent artists to retain 100% of their music sales revenue, officially launched today. The platform represents a fundamental shift from traditional music industry models that typically see artists receive only 15-30% of revenue from their work.

**The Problem:**
Current streaming platforms pay artists an average of $0.003 per stream, requiring 3.3 million streams to generate $10,000 in revenue. Traditional record labels typically retain 70-85% of artist revenue, leaving creators with minimal compensation for their work.

**The Solution:**
Not a Label's direct-to-fan platform allows artists to sell music directly to supporters, keeping 100% of sales revenue while paying only a small platform fee (15% for standard artists, 10% for founding artists) on successful transactions.

**Key Platform Features:**
‚Ä¢ Direct music sales (MP3, FLAC, vinyl pre-orders)
‚Ä¢ AI-powered career assistant providing personalized advice
‚Ä¢ Fan messaging and community building tools
‚Ä¢ NFT music collectibles for super fans
‚Ä¢ Transparent analytics and revenue tracking
‚Ä¢ Growth tools and marketing assistance

**Founding Artist Program:**
The first 100 artists to join receive special status including lifetime reduced fees, platform development input, priority support, and exclusive community access.

**Market Impact:**
"This platform proves that artists can build sustainable careers without sacrificing creative control or financial independence," said Founder Jason Ino. "We're demonstrating that the future of music is direct artist-fan relationships, not corporate intermediaries."

**Technology:**
Built on modern web technologies with blockchain integration for NFTs, AI-powered recommendations, and robust payment processing. The platform is designed to scale with artists as they grow their careers.

**Availability:**
Not a Label is now accepting artist applications at https://not-a-label.art
