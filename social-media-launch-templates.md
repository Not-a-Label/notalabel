### LinkedIn Announcement

**Title:** Launching Not a Label: Empowering Independent Artists to Keep 100% of Their Revenue

I'm thrilled to announce the launch of Not a Label, a platform I've built to fundamentally change how independent artists monetize their music.

**The Problem:**
Traditional music platforms and labels take significant cuts from artist revenues, leaving creators with pennies on the dollar. Streaming pays $0.003 per play. Labels take up to 85% of revenue. It's time for change.

**Our Solution:**
Not a Label is a direct-to-fan platform where artists:
• Keep 100% of their music sales revenue
• Connect directly with supporters
• Access AI-powered career tools
• Create NFT collectibles
• Build sustainable careers

We only take a small platform fee (15%) when you make a sale - if you don't earn, we don't earn.

**For Our First 100 Founding Artists:**
• Lifetime reduced fees (10% instead of 15%)
• Founding Artist badge and recognition
• Direct input on platform features
• Priority support and early access

This isn't just another music platform. It's a movement to put power back in artists' hands.
