**Revolutionizing Music Career Development with AI**

I'm excited to announce the launch of Not a Label - a platform that democratizes access to music industry expertise through AI technology.

**The Problem**: Independent musicians often lack access to professional guidance, leaving them to navigate the complex music industry alone.

**Our Solution**: An AI-powered platform that provides:
✅ 24/7 personalized career guidance
✅ Industry-specific strategies
✅ Goal tracking and progress monitoring
✅ Mobile-first progressive web app
✅ Affordable access to expertise

**Why This Matters**: 
The music industry is evolving rapidly. Artists need real-time, relevant advice to build sustainable careers. Not a Label bridges this gap by combining cutting-edge AI with deep industry knowledge.

**Key Differentiators**:
• No long-term contracts
• Genre-specific guidance
• Constantly updated knowledge base
• Built by and for musicians

We're not replacing human connection in music - we're augmenting artists' capabilities to make informed decisions about their careers.
