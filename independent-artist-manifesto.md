# The Independent Artist Manifesto

## üíî **THE BROKEN PROMISE**

They told us to follow our dreams. Make music. Express ourselves. Change the world with our art.

They didn't tell us we'd have to give up 85% of our revenue to do it.

They didn't mention that 1 million streams would earn us the price of a coffee.

They forgot to explain that we'd need permission from gatekeepers to share our own creations.

**The music industry sold us a dream and delivered a nightmare.**

## üìä **THE BRUTAL MATH**

Let's talk numbers they don't want you to see:

### Streaming Reality:
- **Spotify pays:** $0.003 per stream
- **To earn $1,000:** You need 333,333 streams
- **To earn $10,000:** You need 3.3 MILLION streams
- **To make minimum wage:** You need 4.3 million streams per year

### Label Reality:
- **Label takes:** 70-85% of revenue
- **You create:** 100% of the music
- **You keep:** 15-30% if you're lucky
- **They own:** Your masters, your future, your freedom

### The Real Cost:
- **Recording:** Your money
- **Promotion:** Your hustle
- **Fanbase:** Your relationships
- **Revenue:** Their profit

**This isn't partnership. This is exploitation with a contract.**

## üî• **WE DECLARE INDEPENDENCE**

We, the independent artists, reject this broken system.

We refuse to accept pennies for our passion.

We will not surrender our creative freedom for false promises.

We choose to build direct relationships with our fans.

We demand to keep what we earn.

**We are not a label. We are the future.**

---

## ‚ö° **THE NEW RULES**

### Rule #1: You Own Your Music
No contracts. No masters deals. No giving away your life's work for "exposure."

### Rule #2: You Keep Your Revenue
100% of what fans pay goes to you. Period. No label cuts, no executive bonuses, no shareholder profits.

### Rule #3: You Control Your Career
Your release schedule. Your artistic vision. Your business decisions. Your life.

### Rule #4: You Connect Directly
No algorithms between you and your fans. No corporate filter on your message. Pure connection.

### Rule #5: You Set Your Price
Your music has value. Price it accordingly. Respect your art by expecting fair compensation.

## üöÄ **JOIN THE REVOLUTION**

This isn't just about changing platforms. This is about changing the entire music industry.

When independent artists succeed, we prove that talent doesn't need permission.

When we keep our revenue, we show that creators deserve fair compensation.

When we build direct fan relationships, we demonstrate the power of authentic connection.

**Every independent artist who thrives is a victory against the broken system.**

## üéµ **THE MOVEMENT STARTS NOW**

We are the first generation of artists who don't need record labels to succeed.

We have the technology to distribute globally.

We have the tools to build communities.

We have the platforms to connect directly with fans.

**The only thing we were missing was a platform that respected our independence.**

**That changes today.**

## üíé **FOR THE FIRST 100**

To the artists brave enough to be first. To the creators ready to lead. To the independents who refuse to compromise.

You are not just joining a platform.

**You are founding a movement.**

Your success proves it's possible. Your independence inspires others. Your revenue stays yours.
