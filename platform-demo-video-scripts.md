### Script:

"Hi, I'm [Founder Name], and like you, I'm an independent artist who got tired of the bullshit.

[0:10] I spent years jumping between platforms, losing money to middlemen, and getting generic advice that didn't apply to musicians.

[0:25] So I asked: What if we built something different? By artists. For artists.

[0:35] Not a Label isn't just another platform. It's a movement. We're proving that independent artists can have professional tools without corporate control.

[0:50] Our beta program is where it starts. 500 artists shaping the future of independent music.

[1:05] This isn't about disrupting the industry. It's about empowering the artists who ARE the industry.

[1:20] Join us. Let's build something that actually works for artists like us.

[1:30] Apply at not-a-label.art. Let's make history together."
