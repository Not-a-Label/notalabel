## 🎥 TikTok Scripts

### TikTok 1: "Labels vs Independence"
*Show split screen*

LABELS:
- 360 deals 
- Own your masters
- Control your image
- Take 88% of revenue

INDEPENDENCE with Not a Label:
- Keep 100%
- Own everything
- Be yourself
- Direct to fans

Which side are you on?

### TikTok 2: "Day in the Life"
*POV: You're an artist on Not a Label*

7am: Check analytics - 1K plays overnight 💰
9am: AI suggests posting time
11am: Upload new track in 2 clicks
1pm: Fan tips you $50 directly
3pm: Book studio time with earnings
5pm: Still own 100% of everything

This is the future.

### TikTok 3: "Streaming Math"
*Calculator visual*

Spotify stream = $0.003
1 million streams = $3,000
Label takes 88% = $360 for you

Not a Label:
Fan buys track for $1
You keep $1

Which math do you prefer?
