## ðŸŽ¯ TIER 1: HIGH-PRIORITY TARGETS (Send First)

### Email Template: Exclusive Launch Day Invitation

**Subject:** ðŸš¨ LAUNCHING TODAY: You're on my list of 10 artists who NEED to see this

**Body:**
Hi [ARTIST_NAME],

I'm literally launching Not a Label RIGHT NOW and you're one of the first 10 artists I wanted to personally invite.

**Why you specifically?**
[PERSONALIZED_REASON based on their recent posts/music/career stage]

**What is Not a Label?**
A platform where independent artists keep 100% of their music revenue. No record deals, no middlemen, just you and your fans.

**The math:**
â€¢ Spotify: Need 3.3M streams for $10k
â€¢ Not a Label: Need 1,000 fans buying $10 album = $10k (all yours)

**As one of my first 10 invites, you get:**
â€¢ Founding Artist status (lifetime 10% platform fee vs 15%)
â€¢ Direct input on platform features
â€¢ Recognition as a platform pioneer
â€¢ Exclusive Discord access

**Platform just went live:** https://not-a-label.art

I have 100 founding artist spots total. You're getting the first opportunity because I believe you'd be perfect for this.

Interested? Just reply and I'll get you set up immediately.

Best,
Jason Ino
Founder, Not a Label

P.S. - Platform literally launched 30 minutes ago. You're seeing this before anyone else.
