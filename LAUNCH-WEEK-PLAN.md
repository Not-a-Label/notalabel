## ðŸŽ‰ Remember

Every platform started with zero users. Focus on making your first 10 artists incredibly successful, and they'll bring the next 100.

**Your superpower**: You built this FOR artists, BY someone who understands their struggles.

**Daily mantra**: "One artist at a time, one song at a time, we're changing music."

Let's make this week legendary! ðŸš€ðŸŽµ
