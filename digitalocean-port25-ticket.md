Request to unblock port 25 for legitimate email service

## Message:
Hello DigitalOcean Support,

I need port 25 unblocked for my droplet to operate a legitimate email service.

**Droplet Details:**
- IP Address: 159.89.247.208
- Hostname: not-a-label.art
- Purpose: Transactional emails for music platform

**Email Usage:**
- Welcome emails for new users
- Password reset notifications
- Track upload confirmations
- Support ticket responses
- NO bulk marketing or spam

**Security Measures Implemented:**
- SPF, DKIM, and DMARC configured
- Rate limiting enabled
- Authenticated SMTP only
- Monitoring and logging active

I've set up a professional email server with Postfix, Dovecot, and proper authentication. This is for transactional emails only, not bulk mail.

Please unblock port 25 for this droplet. Thank you!

Best regards,
Jason Ino
