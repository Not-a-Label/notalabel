## ⚡ Launch Sequence (Execute After DNS Update)

### Step 1: Verify DNS Propagation (5-60 minutes)
```bash
# Check if DNS has updated
dig not-a-label.art +short
# Should return: 159.89.247.208

# Test HTTP access
curl -I http://not-a-label.art
# Should connect to our server
```

### Step 2: Deploy SSL Certificate (5 minutes)
```bash
# SSH to production server
ssh root@159.89.247.208

# Run SSL setup script  
bash /tmp/ssl-nginx-setup.sh

# Verify HTTPS works
curl -I https://not-a-label.art
```

### Step 3: Switch to Live Stripe Keys (10 minutes)
```bash
# Activate live Stripe integration
bash /tmp/switch-to-live-stripe.sh

# Test live API
curl https://not-a-label.art/api/health
```

### Step 4: Launch Verification (5 minutes)
```bash
# Test founder dashboard
curl "https://not-a-label.art/api/founder/balance?founder_id=jason_ino_founder"

# Test payment simulation
curl -X POST https://not-a-label.art/api/payments/simulate-payment \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"amount": 100, "payment_type": "test"}'

# Process first real $1 test payment via website
```
